    <h1>Week 9 Notes</h1>
    <p>This week all of the readings come from the Javascript: Novice to Ninja book.</p>
    <a href="/week9/notes9/ch9.html">Chapter 9</a>
    <a href="/week9/notes9/ch14.html">Chapter 14</a>
    <a href="/week9/TeamAct09/index-START.html">Team Activity</a>
    <hr><a href="../index.html">Home</a>

    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Questions:</h3>
    <ol style="text-align: left;">
        <li>In the team activity: the removeTransition does not appear to do anything when we implement it into what our team created? What is it supposed to do?</li>
        <li>The websocket.org link leads to a page that says "space no longer available", so the example in my notes does not work. Do you know of another platform that could be used? I tried to google, but I wasn't exactly sure.</li>
        <li>My github pages don't seem to be able to load my chapter 9 and chapter 14 notes. Do you happen to know why? Or how I can get around that?</li>
    </ol> 

    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Answers:</h3>
    <ol style="text-align: left;">
        <li>Your information is in Github, it's just the link that's broken. 
            It's missing the "WebFrontendDev/" part in the links for the Chapter 9, 
            Chapter 14, and Team Activity buttons. I didn't see a removeTransition function in your 
            code so I'm not exactly sure what your question meant, but if I'm not mistaken, it sounds 
            like that function is supposed to make it so it resets the CSS transition. I could be wrong 
            though. Also, thanks for making me aware of the websocket problem - I am not aware of another 
            websocket site at the moment, so don't worry about that part. We'll see what we can figure 
            out for fixing the course information.</li>
