    <h1>Week 9 Notes</h1>
    <p>This week all of the readings come from the Javascript: Novice to Ninja book.</p>
    <a href="/week9/notes9/ch9.html">Chapter 9</a>
    <a href="/week9/notes9/ch14.html">Chapter 14</a>
    <a href="/week9/TeamAct09/index-START.html">Team Activity</a>
    <a href="../index.html">Home</a>

    <h3>Questions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In the team activity: the removeTransition does not appear to do anything when we implement it into what our team created? What is it supposed to do?</li>
        <li>The websocket.org link leads to a page that says "space no longer available", so the example in my notes does not work. Do you know of another platform that could be used? I tried to google, but I wasn't exactly sure.</li>
        <li>My github pages don't seem to be able to load my chapter 9 and chapter 14 notes. Do you happen to know why? Or how I can get around that?</li>
        
    </ol>
