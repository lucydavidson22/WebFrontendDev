    <h1>The Window Object</h1>
    <p>Every JavaScript environment has a global object. Any variables that are created 
        in the global scope are actually properties of this object, and any functions 
        are methods of it. In a browser environment the global object is the window object, 
        which represents the browser window that contains a web page.</p>

    <h3>The Browser Object Model</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>BOM for short</li>
        <li>a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen</li>
        <li>Remember that JavaScript can be run in different environments. The BOM only makes 
            sense in a browser environment. This means that other environments (such as Node.js) 
            probably won’t have a <span class=code>window</span> object, although they will still 
            have a global object; for example, Node.js has an object called <span class=code>global</span>.</li>
        <li>If you don’t know the name of the global object, you can also refer to it using the 
            keyword this in the global scope. The following code provides a quick way of assigning
            the variable global to the global object: </li>
        <li><span class=code>//from within the global scope<br>&emsp;&nbsp;const global = this;</span></li> 
        <li>Going Global
            <ul>Global variables are actual properties of a global object. </ul>
            <ul>you should refer to global variables without using the window object; 
                it’s less typing and your code will be more portable between environments.</ul>
            <ul>exception is if you need to check whether a global variable has been defined.</ul>
            <ul style="color: yellow"></ul>
        </li>
        <li>Dialogs
            <ul><span  class=code>window.alert('Hello');</span>
                <ul>pause the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog box.</ul>
            </ul>
            <ul><span  class=code>window.confirm('Do you wish to continue?');</span>
                <ul>stop the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog that shows 
                    the message provided as an argument, and giving the options of OK or Cancel</ul>
            </ul>
            <ul><span  class=code>window.prompt('Please enter your name:');</span>
                <ul>stop the execution of the program. It displays a dialog that shows a message 
                    provided as an argument, as well as an input field that allows the user to enter text.</ul>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Browser Information</h3>
    <p>The window object has a number of properties and methods that provide information about the user’s browser</p>
    <ul>Which Browser?
        <li>window object has a navigator property that returns a reference to the Navigator object.</li>
        <li>userAgent property will return information about the browser and operating system being used</li>
        <li><span class=code>window.navigator.userAgent</span></li>
        <li><span style="color:red;">Don’t rely on this information though</span> it can be modified by a user 
            to masquerade as a different browser.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>Location, Location, Location
        <li>window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page.</li>
        <li><span  class=code>window.location.href </span>
            <ul>returns the full URL as a string</ul>
        </li>
        <li><span  class=code>window.location.href = 'https://www.sitepoint.com/javascript/'</span>
            <ul>This property (as well as most of the others in this section) is a read/write property, 
                which means it can also be changed by assignment.</ul>
        </li>
        <li><span  class=code>window.location.protocol</span>
            <ul>returns a string describing the protocol used (such as http, https, pop2, ftp etc.).</ul>
            <ul style="color: yellow">Note that there is a colon (:) at the end</ul>
        </li>
        <li><span  class=code>window.location.host</span>
            <ul>returns a string describing the domain of the current URL and the port number 
                (this is often omitted if the default port 80 is used)</ul>
        </li>
        <li><span  class=code>window.location.hostname</span>
            <ul>returns a string describing the domain of the current URL</ul>
        </li>
        <li><span  class=code>window.location.port</span>
            <ul>returns a string describing the port number, although it will return 
                an empty string if the port is not explicitly stated in the URL</ul>
        </li> <!--    -->
        <li><span  class=code>window.location.pathname</span>
            <ul>returns a string of the path that follows the domain</ul>
        </li>
        <li><span  class=code>window.location.search</span>
            <ul>returns a string that starts with a “?” followed by the query string 
                parameters. It returns an empty string if there are no query string parameters.</ul>
        </li>
        <li><span  class=code>window.location.hash</span>
            <ul>returns a string that starts with a “#” followed by the fragment identifier. 
                It returns an empty string if there is no fragment identifier</ul>
        </li>
        <li><span  class=code>window.location.origin</span>
            <ul>returns a string that shows the protocol and domain where the current page 
                originated from. This property is read-only, so cannot be changed</ul>
        </li>
        <li>The window.location object also has the following methods:
            <ul>The reload() method can be used to force a reload of the current page. If it’s 
                given a parameter of true, it will force the browser to reload the page from the server, 
                instead of using a cached page.</ul>
            <ul>The assign() method can be used to load another resource from a URL provided as a parameter, for example:</ul>
            <ul>The replace() method is almost the same as the assign() method, except the current page will 
                not be stored in the session history, so the user will be unable to navigate back to it using the back button.</ul>
            <ul>The toString() method returns a string containing the whole URL:</ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Browser History</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The window.history property can be used to access information about any previously visited pages 
            in the current browser session</li>
        <li>The window.history.length property shows how many pages have been visited before arriving at the current page.</li>
        <li>The window.history.go() method can be used to go to a specific page, where 0 is the current page</li>
        <li>There are also the window.history.forward() and window.history.back() methods that can be used to navigate 
            forwards and backwards by one page respectively, just like using the browser’s forward and back buttons.</li>
    </ul>
    

    <h3>Controlling Windows</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A new window can be opened using the <span class=code>window.open()</span> method.</li>
        <li>The <span class=code>close()</span> method can be used to close a window, assuming you have a reference to it</li>
        <li>possible to move a window using the <span class=code>window.moveTo()</span> method. 
            This takes two parameters that are the X and Y coordinates of the screen that the window is to be moved to:
            <ul class=code>window.moveTo(0,0); // will move the window to the top-left corner of the screen</ul>
        </li>
        <li>resize a window using the <span class=code>window.resizeTo()</span> method. 
            This takes two parameters that specify the width and height of the resized window’s dimensions:
        <ul class=code>window.resizeTo(600,400);</ul></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Screen Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span class=code>window.screen</span> object contains information about the screen the browser is displayed on. 
            You can find out the height and width of the screen in pixels using the height and width properties respectively:
        <ul class=code>window.screen.height<br>&nbsp;<< 1024<br> window.screen.width<br>&nbsp;<< 1280 </ul></li>
        <li>The availHeight and availWidth can be used to find the height and width of the screen, 
            excluding any operating system menus</li>
        <li>colorDepth property can be used to find the color bit depth of the user’s monitor, 
            although there are few use cases for doing this other than collecting user statistics</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Document Object</h3>
    <p>Each window object contains a document object. This object has properties and methods that 
        deal with the page that has been loaded into the window. </p>
    <ul><span class=code>document.write()</span>
        <li>write() method simply writes a string of text to the page. If a page has already loaded, 
            it will completely replace the current document:
        <ul class=code>document.write('Hello, world!);</ul>
        <ul>document.write() method can also be used within a document inside <"script"> tags to inject a string into the markup.</ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>Cookies 
        <li>small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer. </li>
        <li>a browser does not remember anything from one request to another. So every time a user visits a page, 
            nothing about any previous visits is remembered. </li>
        <li>Cookies can be used to sidestep this problem by storing information that can then be retrieved between requests.</li>
        <li>Cookies are also limited to storing up to 4KB of data, although 20 cookies are allowed per domain, 
            which can add up to quite a lot of data.</li>
        <li>Cookies can be used for personalizing a user’s browsing experience, 
            storing user preferences, keeping track of user choices (such as a shopping cart), 
            authentication and tracking users. </li>
        <li>Creating Cookies
            <ul>To create a cookie, you assign it to JavaScript’s “cookie jar”, using the document.cookie property, like so:
                <li class=code>document.cookie = 'name=Superman';<br> &nbsp;<< "name=Superman"</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Changing Cookie Values:
            <ul>A cookie’s value can be changed by reassigning it to document.cookie using the same name but a different value. </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Reading Cookies
            <ul>To see the current contents of the cookie jar, simply enter document.cookie</ul>
            <ul>use the split method to break the string into an array containing each name/value pair, 
                then use a for of loop to iterate through the array</ul>
        </li>
        <li>Cookie Expiry Dates
            <ul>Cookies are session cookies by default. This means they are deleted once a browser 
                session is finished (when the user closes the browser tab or window). </ul>
            <ul>Cookies can be made persistent ― that is, lasting beyond the browser session ― by adding 
                "; expires=date" to the end of the cookie when it’s set, where date is a date value in the 
                UTC String format Day, DD-Mon-YYYY HH:MM:SS GMT.</ul>
            <ul>alternative is to set the max-age value</ul>
        </li>
        <li>The Path and Domain of Cookies
            <ul>cookies can only be read by pages inside the same directory and domain as the file was set. </ul>
            <ul>This is for security reasons so that access to the cookie is limited.</ul>
        </li>
        <li>Deleting Cookies
            <ul>To remove a cookie, you need to set it to expire at a time in the past:
                <ul class=code>document.cookie = 'name=Batman; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:01 GMT';</ul>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Timing Functions</h3>
    <ul><span class=code>setTimeout()</span>
        <li> accepts a callback to a function as its first parameter and a number of milliseconds as its second parameter.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>setInterval()</h3>
    <ul><span class=code>setInterval()</span>
        <li>works in a similar way to window.setTimeout(), except that it will repeatedly invoke the callback 
            function after every given number of milliseconds.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Animation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span class=code>setTimeout()</span> and <span class=code>setInterval()</span> methods can be used to 
            animate elements on a web page.</li>
        <li><a href="animation/index.html">Animation Example</a></li>
        <li>requestAnimationFrame()</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Chapter Summary</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The window object is the global object in a browser.</li>
        <li>Global variables are actually properties of the window object in a browser environment.</li>
        <li>alert, confirm(), and prompt() are all methods of the window object, and open dialogs that 
            halt the execution of the program.</li>
        <li>The window.navigator object gives information about the user’s browser and operating system, 
            although it can be unreliable.</li>
        <li>The window.location object provides information about the URL of the current page.</li>
        <li>The window.history object keeps information about the pages that have been visited in the session.</li>
        <li>You can open, close, resize, and move windows (although, this doesn’t mean you should!).</li>
        <li>The window.screen object provides information about the user’s screen.</li>
        <li>document.write() is an archaic method of writing text to the document and should be avoided.</li>
        <li>Cookies can be used to store small pieces of information between requests using the document.cookie property.</li>
        <li>The window.setTimeout() method can be used to invoke a function after a set amount of time. It can be 
            canceled using the clearTimeout() method.</li>
        <li>The window.setInterval() method can be used to repeatedly invoke a function. It can be stopped using the 
            clearInterval() method.</li>
        <li>The window.requestAnimationFrame() method can be used to produce smooth and optimized animation by 
            utilizing the browser's built-in graphics capabilities. It can be canceled using the cancelAnimationFrame() method.</li>
        
    </ul>
