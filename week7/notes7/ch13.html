    <h1>Chapter 13 Notes</h1>
    <p>A technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically 
        updates web pages without reloading</p>
    <p>Enables data to be sent and received in the background, as well as portions of a page to be 
        updated in response to user events, while the rest of the program continues to run.</p>
    <h3>Clients and Servers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The internet can be separated into two parts: clients and servers
            <ul>client, such as a web browser, will request a resource (usually a web page) from a 
                server, which processes the request and sends back a response to the client</ul>
        </li>
        <li>Ajax allows JavaScript to request resources from a server on behalf of the client. 
            The resources requested are usually JSON data or small fragments of text or HTML rather 
            than a whole web page</li>
        <li>a server is required when requesting resources using Ajax</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>A Brief History of Ajax</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In 1999, Microsoft implemented the XMLHTTP ActiveX control in Internet Explorer 5. 
            <ul>It was developed initially for the Outlook web client, and allowed data to be sent 
            asynchronously in the background using JavaScript. Other browsers implemented this technique, 
            although it remained a relatively unknown feature, and was rarely used.</ul></li>
        <li>Asynchronous loading techniques started to be noticed when Google launched Gmail and Google 
            Maps in 2004 and 2005 respectively. </li>
        <li>The term 'Ajax' was coined by Jesse James Garrett in 2005 in the article “Ajax: A New Approach 
            to Web Applications,” where he referred to techniques being used by Google in its recent web applications.</li>
        <li> Ajax was a neat acronym that referred to the different parts of the process being used: Asynchronous 
            JavaScript and XML:</li>
        <li>Asynchronous
            <ul>When a request for data is sent, the program doesn’t have to stop and wait for the response. 
            It can carry on running, waiting for an event to fire when a response is received. By using callbacks 
            to manage this, programs are able to run in an efficient way, avoiding lag as data is transferred back and forth.</ul></li>
        <li>JavaScript
            <ul>JavaScript was always considered a 'front-end' language, not used to communicate with the server. Ajax enabled 
                JavaScript to send requests and receive responses from a server, allowing content to be updated in real time.</ul>
        </li>
        <li>XML
            <ul>When the term Ajax was originally coined, XML documents were often used to return data.
                Many different types of data can be sent, but by far the most commonly used in Ajax nowadays is JSON, 
                which is more lightweight and easier to parse than XML. (Although it has never really taken off, the 
                term Ajaj is sometimes used to describe the technique.) JSON also has the advantage of being natively 
                supported in JavaScript, so you can deal with JavaScript objects rather than having to parse XML files 
                using DOM methods.</ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Fetch API</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>which is currently a living standard for requesting and sending data asynchronously across a network.</li>
        <li>uses promises to avoid callback hell, and also streamlines a number of concepts that had become cumbersome 
            when using the XMLHttpRequest object</li>
        <li>Basic Usage
            <ul>Fetch API provides a global <span class="code">fetch()</span> method that only has one mandatory 
                argument, which is the URL of the resource you wish to fetch</ul>
                <ul>the fetch() method returns a promise that resolves to the response returned from the URL 
                    that was provided as an argument</ul>
        </li>
        <li>Response Interface
            <ul>Fetch API introduced the Response interface that deals with the object that’s returned when the promise is fulfilled</ul>
            <ul>Response objects have a number of properties and methods that allow us to process the response effectively</ul>
            <ul>each response object has an <span class="code">ok</span> property that checks to see if the response is successful. 
                This is based on the 
                HTTP status code, which can be accessed using the <span class="code">status</span> property.
                <ul>This will usually be <span class="code">200</span> if the response was successful, 
                    <span class="code">201</span><span style="color:yellow"> if a resource was created</span>, 
                    or <span class="code">204</span><span style="color:yellow"> when the request is successful but no content is returned</span>. 
                    The <span class="code">ok</span> property will return <span class="code">true</span> if the 
                    <span class="code">status</span> property is between 200 and 299. We need to manually check if this happens 
                    because the promise will only be rejected in the case of a network error, rather than something like a 
                    '404 page not found error', which is still considered a successful request in terms of the promise.</ul></ul>
            <ul>Some other properties of the Response object are:
                <ul><span class="code">headers</span> – A Headers object (see later section) containing any headers 
                    associated with the response</ul>
                <ul><span class="code">url</span> – A string containing the URL of response</ul>
                <ul><span class="code">redirected</span> – A boolean value that specifies if the response is the result of a redirect</ul>
                <ul><span class="code">type</span> - A string value of 'basic', 'cors', 'error' or 'opaque'. A value of 'basic' is used 
                    for a response from the same domain. A value of 'cors' means the data was received from a valid cross-origin 
                    request from a different domain. A value of 'opaque' is used for a response received from 'no-cors' request from 
                    another domain, which means access to the data will be severely restricted. A value of 'error' is used when a 
                    network error occurs.</ul>
            </ul>
            <ul>Redirects
                <ul><span class="code">redirect()</span> method can be used to redirect to another URL by creating  a new promise that 
                    resolves to the response from the redirected URL</ul>
            </ul>
            <ul>Text Responses
                <ul><span class="code">text()</span> method takes a stream of text from the response, reads it to completion and then 
                    returns a promise that resolves to a USVSting object that can be treated as a string in JavaScript.</ul>
            </ul>
            <ul>File Responses
                <ul><span class="code">blob()</span> method is used to read a file of raw data, such as an image or a spreadsheet.</ul>
                <ul>once it has read the whole file, it returns a promise that resolves with a <span class="code">blob()</span> object.</ul>
            </ul>
            <ul>JSON Responses
                <ul><span class="code">json()</span> method is used to deal with these by transforming a stream of JSON data into a 
                    promise that resolves to a JavaScript object.</ul>
            </ul>
            <ul>Creating Responses Objects
                <ul>you can also create your own response objects using a constructor function</ul>
            </ul>
            <ul>Request Interface
                <ul>We can get more fine-grained control over the request being made by providing a <span class="code">Request</span> 
                    object as an argument. This allows a number of options to be set about the request.</ul>
                <ul>Request objects are created using the <span class="code">Request()</span> constructor, and include the 
                    following properties:
                    <ul><span class="code">url</span> – The URL of the requested resource (the only property that is required).</ul>
                    <ul><span class="code">method</span> – a string that specifies which HTTP method should be used for the request. 
                        By default, this is 'GET'.</ul>
                    <ul><span class="code">headers</span> – This is a <span class="code">Headers</span> object (see later section) that provides details of the 
                        request's headers.</ul>
                    <ul><span class="code">mode</span> – Allows you to specify if CORS is used or not. CORS is enabled by default.</ul>
                    <ul><span class="code">cache</span> – Allows you to specify how the request will use the browser's cache. For 
                        example, you can force it to request a resource and update the cache with the result, or you can force it to only 
                        look in the cache for the resource.</ul>
                    <ul><span class="code">credentials</span> – Lets you specify if cookies should be allowed with the request.</ul>
                    <ul><span class="code">redirect</span> – Specifies what to do if the response returns a redirect. There’s a choice of 
                        three values: 'follow' (the redirect is followed), 'error' (an error is thrown) or 'manual' (the user has to 
                        click on a link to follow the redirect).</ul>
                </ul>
                <ul>A constructor function is used to create a new Request object</ul>
                <ul>The <span class="code">url</span> property is the first argument, and is required. 
                    The second argument is an object made up of any of the other properties listed above</ul>
                <ul>Headers Interface
                    <ul>headers are used to pass on any additional information about a request or response</ul>
                    <ul>information contained in headers includes the file-type of the resource, cookie information, 
                        authentication information and when the resource was last modified</ul>
                        <ul>can be used to create a Headers object, which can then be added as a property of Request and Response objects.</ul>
                        <ul><span class="code">has()</span> – Can be used to check if the headers object contains the header provided as an argument.</ul>
                        <ul><span class="code">get()</span>  - Returns the value of the header provided as an argument</ul>
                        <ul><span class="code">set()</span> – Can be used to set a value of an already existing header, or create a new 
                            header with the value provided as an argument if it does not already exist.</ul>
                        <ul><span class="code">append()</span> – Adds a new header to the headers object.</ul>
                        <ul><span class="code">delete()</span> – Removes the header provided as an argument.</ul>
                        <ul><span class="code">keys(), values() </span>and <span class="code">entries()</span>  – Iterators that can be 
                            used to iterate over the headers key, values or entries (key and value pairs).</ul>
                </ul>
                <ul>Putting It All Together
                    <ul>We can use the Headers, Request and Response objects to put together a typical example that sets up the 
                        URL, Request and Headers before calling the <span class="code">fetch()</span> method:<br>
                        <span class="code">
                            const url = 'https:example.com/data';<br>
                            const headers = new Headers({ 'Content-Type': 'text/plain', 
                            'Accept-Charset' : 'utf-8', 'Accept-Encoding':'gzip,deflate' })<br><br>

                            const request = (url,{<br>
                                &emsp;&emsp;headers: headers<br>
                            })<br><br>

                            fetch(request)<br>
                            .then( function(response) {<br>
                                &emsp;&emsp;if(response.ok) {<br>
                                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;return response;<br>
                                    &emsp;&emsp;}<br>
                                    &emsp;&emsp;throw Error(response.statusText);<br>
                            })<br>
                            .then( response => // do something with response )<br>
                            .catch( error => console.log('There was an error!') )<br>
                        </span>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Receiving Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="ajax.html">Ajax Example</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sending Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>We can also use Ajax to send information. This can be a variety of formats, but is usually a JSON string</li>
        <li>This <a href="todo.html">To Do</a> will output an id to the console</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>FormData</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fetch API includes the FormData interface, which makes it much easier to submit information in forms using Ajax</li>
        <li>A FormData instance is created using a constructor function:<br>
            <span class="code">const data = new FormData();</span></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>A Living Standard</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The Fetch API is, at the time of writing, what is known as a 'living standard', which means that the 
            specification is being developed 'in the wild'</li>
        <li>despite it being available to use, it’s still subject to change as developers, browser vendors 
            and end-users provide feedback about how it works</li>
            <li>If you don't want to 'live on the edge', you could consider using a library to take care of Ajax 
                requests. The advantage of this approach is that the library will take care of any implementation 
                details behind the scenes – it will use the most up-to-date methods, such as the 
                <span class="code">fetch</span> API, if it's supported, and fallback on using older methods, if required.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Chapter Summary</h3>
    <ul>

        <li>The Response interface allows you to control the response received from a request or to create your own response objects.</li>
        <li>The Request interface allows you to create a request object that contains information about the request being made, such as the URL and headers.</li>
        <li>The Headers interface allows you to create HTTP headers that can be added to a request or response object.</li>
        <li>Requests can retrieve data using a GET request, or send data using a POST request.</li>
        <li>The FormData interface makes it easier to send data from forms.</li></ul>
