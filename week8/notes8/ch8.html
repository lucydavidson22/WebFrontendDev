    <h3>Transforms</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page</li>
        <li>We can manipulate an element’s appearance using transform functions</li>
        <li>value of the transform property is one or more transform functions (separated by spaces) that will be 
            applied in the order they’re provided</li>
        <li>Translation
            <ul>allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down</ul>
            <ul>similar to the behavior of <span class="code">position: relative;</span> when declaring 
                <span class="code">top</span> and <span class="code">left</span>, moving elements up and down or 
                left and right along the x and y axes</ul>
            <ul>When you employ a translation function, you’re moving elements without impacting the flow of the document.</ul>
            <ul>Unlike <span class="code">position: relative</span>, which allows you to position an element either against 
                its current position or against a parent or other ancestor, a translated element can only be moved relative 
                to its current position</ul>
            <ul>The <span class="code">translate(x,y)</span> function moves an element <span class="code">x</span> from the left, 
                and <span class="code">y</span> from the top: <span class="code">transform: translate(45px, -45px);</span></ul>
        </li>
        <li><span style="color:yellow"><b>Note: Transforms and Older Browsers</b></span>
            <ul>Transforms require vendor prefixing for IE9, Android up to 4.4.3, iOS8, and Blackberry 10. To make the 
                aforementioned code work in IE9 and older mobile WebKit browsers, you would include the following:
                <br><span class="code">-webkit-transform: translate(45px,-45px); /* iOS8, Android 
                    ↵4.4.3, BB10 */
                    -ms-transform: translate(45px,-45px); /* IE9 only */
                    transform: translate(45px,-45px);</span>
            </ul>
            <ul>To move an element vertically or horizontally, you can use the <span class="code">translatex</span> 
                or <span class="code">translatey</span> functions respectively. To move 45px to the right along the x axis, 
                include:<br><span class="code">transform: translateX(45px);</span></ul>
            <ul>To move up along the y axis by 30px, include:<br>
                <span class="code">transform: translateY(-30px);</span></ul>
        </li> 
        <li>Scaling
            <ul><span class="code">scale(x,y)</span> function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally 
                then vertically</ul>
                <ul>As with translate, you can also use the <span class="code">scaleX(x)</span> or  <span class="code">scaleY(y)</span> functions</ul>
                <ul>You shouldn’t declare a new <span class="code">transform</span>: because of the cascade, a second 
                    <span class="code">transform</span> would override the first</ul>
                <ul style="color: yellow"> worth remembering that scaling, like translation, has no impact on the document flow</ul>
        </li>
        <li>Rotation
            <ul><span class="code">rotate()</span> function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value</ul>
        </li>  
        <li>Skew
            <ul><span class="code">skew(x,y)</span> function specifies a skew along the x and y axes</ul>
            <ul><span class="code">transform: skew(15deg, 4deg);</span></ul>
        </li>  
        <li>Changing the Origin of the Transform
            <ul>Let’s say that you were transforming a circle. </ul>
            <ul>Because the default <span class="code">transform-origin</span> is the center of the circle, applying a <span class="code">rotate()</span> transform to a circle 
                would have no visible effect—a circle rotated 90 degrees still looks exactly the same as it did before being rotated. 
                An ellipse rotated 180 degrees around its center would also look the same as it did before being rotated upside down. 
                However, if you gave your circle or ellipse a <span class="code">transform-origin</span> of <span class="code">10% 10%</span> or 
                <span class="code">top center</span>.</ul>     
        </li> 
    </ul>

    <h3>Transitions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time, essentially providing simple animations</li>
        <li>CSS transitions are declared along with the regular styles on an element.</li>
        <li>Here are the steps to create a simple transition using only CSS:<br> 
            <ol><li>Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration.</li>
                <li>Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state.</li>
                <li>Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the transition properties, including: transition-property, 
                    transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. We’ll look at each of these and how they work shortly.</li>
        </ol></li>
        <li><span class='code'>transition-property</span> Property defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned, with all for all properties being the default
        </li> 
        <li>Note: Supporting Older Browsers
            <ul>To support older WebKit browsers, you need to include the -webkit- prefix for all of your transition properties</ul>
            <ul>You may also need to specify the -webkit- prefixed forms of properties</ul>
        </li>
        <li>The <span class="code">transition-duration</span> Property
            <ul>The <span class="code">transition-duration</span> property sets how long the transition will take: the duration of time it takes to go from the default state to the transitioned state</ul>
            <ul>200ms is generally considered the optimum time for a transition: anything slower will make the website seem slow, drawing generally 
                unwanted attention to what was supposed to be a subtle effect</ul>
        </li>
        <li>Note: Automatic Graceful Degradation</li>
        <li>The <span class="code">transition-timing-function</span> Property
            <ul>The most common timing functions include the key terms <span class="code">ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, or ease-in-out.</span>
                The default <span class="code">ease</span> has a slow start, then it speeds up, and ends slowly. <span class="code">ease-in-out</span> 
                is similar to ease, but accelerates more sharply at the beginning</ul>
                <ul>For our transition, we’ll use <span class="code">ease-out</span>:
                    <span class="code">transition-timing-function: ease-out;</span></ul>
        </li>
        <li>The <span class=code>transition-delay</span> Property
            <ul>by using the transition-delay property, it’s possible to introduce a delay before the transition begins</ul>
            <ul>A 50ms delay is enough time to wait to be sure they are intentionally hovering over our advertisement:<br>
                <span class=code>
                -webkit-transition-delay: 50ms;
                transition-delay: 50ms;</span></ul>
        </li>
        <li>Tip: Negative Delays
            <ul>a negative time delay that’s less than the duration of the entire transition will cause it to start immediately, but it will start partway through the animation</ul>
            <ul>if you have a delay of -500ms on a 2s transition, the transition will start a quarter of the way through, and will last 1.5 seconds</ul>
        </li>
        <li>The <span class=code>transition</span> Shorthand Property
            <ul><span class=code>.ad-ad2 h1 span {<br>
                transition-property: transform; <br>
                transition-duration: 0.2s;  <br>
                transition-timing-function: ease-out; <br>
                transition-delay: 50ms; <br>
            }</span> <br>turns into this:</ul>
            <ul><span class=code>.ad-ad2 h1 span {<br>
                transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms;<br>
            }</span></ul>
        </li>
        <li>Multiple Transitions
            <ul>The <span class=code>transition</span> properties allow for multiple transitions in one call. For example, if we want to 
                change the color at the same time as changing the rotation and size, we can.</ul>
            <ul>Let’s say instead of just transitioning the rotation, we transition the text’s <span class=code>color</span> property as well. We’d have to first 
                include a <span class=code>color</span> property in the transitioned style declaration, and then either add the <span class=code>color</span> property in the 
                <span class=code>transition-property</span> value list, or use the key term all:</ul>
            <ul><span class=code>transition-property: transform, color; <br>
                transition-duration: 0.2s;  <br>
                transition-timing-function: ease-out;<br>
                transition-delay: 50ms;</span></ul>
        </li>
    <h3>Animations</h3>
    <li>Transitions animate elements over time</li>
    <li><b>CSS animations</b>, unlike transitions, allow you to control each step of an animation via keyframes.</li>
    <li>A <b>keyframe</b> is a snapshot that defines a starting or end point of any smooth transition</li>
    <li>Keyframes
        <ul>To animate an element in CSS, you first create a named animation, then attach it to an element in that element’s property declaration block.</ul>
        <ul>To create an animation, use the @keyframes rule for IE10+ and FF16+.</ul>
        <ul><span class="color:red">Do not quote the animation name.</span></ul>
        <ul>There are two keyterms― from and to ―which evaluate to 0% and 100% respectively. These values specify how far along the animation each keyframe is located.</ul>
    </li>
    <li>Animation properties
        <ul>The animation properties, remembering that you will need two declarations for each property as the -webkit- prefix is still needed in WebKit browsers, are as follows:
            <ul><span class=code>animation-name</span></ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>This property is used to attach an animation (previously defined using the @keyframes syntax) to an element:
            <ul><span class=code>animation-name: appearDisappeaar;</span></ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>Note that you should not put quotes around the animation name in either the property value or the @keyframes at-rule, as the specifications state the name is an identifier and not a string, so browsers don’t support quoted animation names.
            <ul><span class=code>animation-duration</span></ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>The animation-duration property defines the length of time (in seconds or milliseconds) an animation takes to complete one iteration (all the way through, from 0% to 100%):
            <ul><span class=code>animation-duration: 300ms;</span></ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>animation-timing-function
            <ul>Like the transition-timing-function property, the animation-timing-function determines how the animation will progress over its duration. The options are the same as for 
            transition-timing-function: ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, a developer-defined cubic-bezier() function, step-start, step-end, or a developer-defined number 
            of steps with the steps(number, direction) function:</ul>
            <ul><span class=code>animation-timing-function: linear;</span></ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>animation-iteration-count
            <ul>The <span class=code>animation-iteration-count</span> property lets you define how many times the animation will play through.
            <ul>
                <span class=code>animation-iteration-count: infinite;</span>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>animation-direction
            <span class=code>animation-direction: alternate;</span>
        </ul>
        <ul>animation-delay
            <ul>The animation-delay property is used to define how many milliseconds or seconds to wait before the browser begins the animation:
            <span class=code>animation-delay: 50ms;</span>
            <span class=code>animation-fill-mode</span>
            <ul>The <span class=code>animation-fill-mode</span> property defines what happens before the first animation iteration begins and after the last animation iteration concludes</ul>
            <ul>available values are <span class=code>none, forwards, backwards, or both</span></ul>
        </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>The Shorthand <span class=code>animation </span> Property
           <ul>Fortunately, there’s a shorthand for all of these animation properties, especially since we’re still including the 
               <span class=code>-webkit-</span> prefix. The <span class=code>animation</span> property takes as its value
               space-separated list of values for the longhand <span class=code>animation-name, animation-duration, animation-timing-function, 
                animation-delay, animation-iteration-count, animation-direction, animation-fill-mode, and animation-play-state</span> properties:</ul>
                <ul><span class=code>.verbose { <br>
                    animation-name: appearDisappear;  <br>
                    animation-duration: 300ms;  <br>
                    animation-timing-function: ease-in; <br>
                    animation-iteration-count: 1; <br>
                    animation-direction: alternate; <br>
                    animation-delay: 5s; <br>
                    animation-fill-mode: backwards; <br>
                    animation-play-state: running; <br>
                } <br>
                
                /* shorthand */ <br>
                .concise { <br>
                    animation: 300ms ease-in alternate 5s backwards appearDisappear; <br>
                } <br></span></ul>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Warning: Be Careful with Naming
        <ul>If using the shorthand property, be careful with your animation-name. 
            You want to avoid accidentally using any animation property key term such as <span class=code>forwards, running, or alternate.</span></ul>
    </li>
