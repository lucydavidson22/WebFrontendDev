    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Questions:</h3>
    <ol style="text-align: left;">
        <li>I'm a little confused on how you tie the canvas to the functions, could you explain? I was able to build the 
            canvas but not tie the functions to them so they don't do anything.</li>
        <li>Are there any ideas for the kinds of applications we should be preparing to build for the big project coming up?</li>
        
    </ol>
