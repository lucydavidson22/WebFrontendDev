    <h3>Questions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>I'm a little confused on how you tie the canvas to the functions, could you explain? I was able to build the 
            canvas but not tie the functions to them so they don't do anything.</li>
        <li>Can you have more than one svg tag at a time? When I tried to write multiple, it only shows the first one.</li>
        <li>Are there any ideas for the kinds of applications we should be preparing to build for the big project coming up?</li>
        
    </ol>
