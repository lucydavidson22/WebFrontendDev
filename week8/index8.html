    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Questions:</h3>
    <ol style="text-align: left;">
        <li>I'm a little confused on how you tie the canvas to the functions, could you explain? I was able to build the 
            canvas but not tie the functions to them so they don't do anything.</li>
        <li>Are there any ideas for the kinds of applications we should be preparing to build for the big project coming up?</li>
    </ol>

    <ol style="text-align: left;">
        <li>It's exciting to see some of the uses of these concepts! I'm sorry the canvas 
            isn't working as you're expecting... I tried looking through your notes and found that 
            the canvas example web page is missing so I'm not able to troubleshoot and find the problem. 
            I suggest looking at the w3schools examples for canvas: 
            https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp - I appreciate how there are "try it now" 
            examples and they show good examples of the functions. </li>
        <li>For the application that you'll be making for the Challenge #2, I suggest looking for APIs that 
            are interesting that you might be able to utilize in an interesting way... some examples are Weather 
            API, Recipe API, the Pokemon or Star Wars API, or try to think of something you really enjoy and see 
            if there's an API for that (maybe like a Music or Sports API, for example). Then think about how you 
            can add some value to the information that you'd be getting, like showing animated weather, a fun 
            display of Pokemon, etc. Hopefully this helps - let me know if you have more questions!</li>
