    <h1>Notes</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
          Mobile First Design
          <ul>We need to reqire our brains to do mobile designing first. </ul>
          <ul>Mobile traffic from 2013-2014 increased by 20%. This means that more people are choosing to look
              at the web using mobile devices more and more. Webpages need to be fully equipped to handle this.
          </ul>
          <ul>Just because a website is responsive, does not mean its mobile first.</ul>
          <ul>Responsive Retrofitting</ul>
          <ul>Start Small and Scale Up</ul>
        </li>

          Understanding Users
          <b><ul>Be There</ul>
          <ul>Be Useful</ul>
          <ul>Be Quick</ul></b>
          <ul>75% of users rely on thumbs, make sites accessible from your thumb.</ul>
          <ul>Speed Matters</ul>
          <ul>Networks Matter</ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Better Mobile Menus
          <ul>Be empathetic to user needs</ul>
          <ul>Most commonly used menu items should be at the bottom</ul>
          <ul>Hamburger symbol is hindering many people, not helping.</ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Mobile Friendly Forms
          <ul>Make it simple. Make users think less.</ul>
          <ul>Ditch labels, they take up valuable space. Use placeholders instead.</ul>
          <ul><b>Float Labels</b> are labels that go to the top of a field when user is typing. So the 
          user can still see what they should be filling in.</ul>
          <ul>Don't ask for unnecessary information.</ul>
          <ul>Passwords Matter - Show passwords by default, but give the user the option.</ul>
          <ul>Numbers Matter - Space numbers accurately and use the number pad.</ul>
          <ul>Calls Matter - Link phone numbers on the website to make call easier for users. </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Better Mobile Advertising
          <ul>Pop-Ups are the most detested thing on the web.</ul>
          <ul>Don't have big ads - instead do ads between content or at bottom of page. </ul>
          <ul><b>CONTENT SHOULD COME FIRST!</b></ul>
        </li>
